Driver for the DHT11 Temperature/Humidity Sensor
===================================

Author: [Tom Byrne](https://github.com/tombrew/)

Driver class for a [DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht). This class is also compatible with the [RHT03 temperature/humidity sensor](http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Sensors/Weather/RHT03.pdf)

Datasheets for this part are quite numerous and varied; [this one was useful](http://akizukidenshi.com/download/ds/aosong/DHT11.pdf) in writing this class.

## Hardware Setup
The DHTxx family uses a proprietary 1-wire protocol. The imp can emulate this protocol with SPI, using both the MISO and MOSI lines. To use, tie MISO and MOSI together with a 1kÎ© resistor, then tie MISO to the DATA line on the DHTxx.
